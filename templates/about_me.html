    <h1>Hi!</h1>
    <p>This project was designed during HackIllinois 2023 by me, Aadarsh.<p> 
    <p>A little about me: I'm a Computer Science student at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and have more recently started appreciating travel more so I thought I'd create a tool that might help others create a fun bucket list!</p>
